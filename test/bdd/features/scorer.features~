Feature: A script that tally the score of a basketball game

As a scorer I want to be able to view the basketball match score
and tally the points of both teams


Scenario: View score
Given the following match score:
| team_name | score |
| alpha     | 0     |
| beta      | 0     |
When I visit the homepage
Then I see:
| alpha | beta |
| 0     | 0    |

Scenario: Tally score
Given the following match score:
| team_name | score |
| alpha     | 0     |
| beta      | 0     |
And I am in the homepage
When I input team_name as "alpha" and score as "2"
Then I see the team alpha score "2"
